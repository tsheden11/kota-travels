              He lived and experienced Bhutan as a traveler at heart, riding
              through Bhutan on his favorite motorbike, discovering hidden routes,

              The name Kota means "little boy" - a reminder of how travel should
              feel. Curious. Carefree. Open. Free from limitations or rigid
              itineraries. Just as a child explores the world with wonder, we
              believe Bhutan should be experienced with the same sense of freedom
              and joy.
